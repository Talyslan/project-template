# 🧠 Pre-Project · Brainstorm & Organization

> You can delete this file later.  
> It exists only to organize the idea in your head before documenting each step properly.
>
> Golden rule:  
> No line of code before this document makes sense.

## 1. Raw idea (no judgment)

Describe the idea in the rawest way possible.

- Where did this idea come from?
- Is it something I experienced or observed?
- Why did this bother me?

## 2. Problem / Pain

- Is this pain or just curiosity?
- In what situation does it appear?
- How does this person solve it today?
- Why is the current solution bad or insufficient?

⚠️ If it doesn’t hurt, it’s not a problem — it’s curiosity.

## 3. Target user

- Who exactly is this user?
- Context (work, study, routine)
- What does this person NOT want to waste time doing?
- What do they use today instead?

Anti-patterns:

- “anyone”
- “everyone goes through this”

## 4. Assumptions (hypotheses)

List everything you are **assuming** to be true.

- I believe the user…
- I believe this happens frequently…
- I believe they would pay / use this…

👉 Mark what has not been validated yet.

## 5. Value proposition

Complete the sentence:

> For **[user]** who struggles with **[pain]**,  
> this product helps **[outcome]**,  
> without **[current frustration]**.

If it sounds generic, go back to the problem.

## 6. MVP (minimum of the minimum)

- What is **one core action**?
- What is **one immediate value return**?

❌ Out of scope for the MVP:

- excessive customization
- multiple flows
- “cool” automations

If you can remove it and still validate, remove it.

## 7. User flow (high level)

1. Where does the user arrive from?
2. What do they do first?
3. What value do they receive?
4. What do they leave with solved?

No screens yet — logic only.

## 8. No-code validation

- How can this be validated **before** coding?
- What would be a clear signal of interest?
- What would prove this idea is weak?

Examples:

- conversations with real people
- clickable prototype
- simple form
- manual test

## 9. Technical goal (as a developer)

This project exists to:

- learn what?
- demonstrate what?
- practice which architectural decision?

⚠️ If the goal is just “training a stack”, admit it.

## 10. Success criteria

- What defines MVP success?
- Simple, observable metric

Examples:

- people actively using it
- spontaneous feedback
- recurring usage

## 11. Risks and observations

- Fragile assumptions
- Overengineering risk
- External dependencies
- Reasons to kill the project
