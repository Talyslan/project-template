## 🐞 Found a bug?

Before opening a new issue, please:

- Check if the bug has already been reported in the  
  [Issues](https://github.com/Username/repository-template/issues).

If you don’t find anything related:

- Open a new issue and include:
  - A clear title and description
  - Steps to reproduce the problem
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Screenshots, images, or examples if possible

The more context you provide, the easier it is to help.

## 🔧 Fixed a bug?

Nice!  
To submit your fix:

- Open a Pull Request with a clear description of:
  - What was fixed
  - Why it was fixed
- Link the related issue if one exists

Small, focused PRs are always easier to review 🙂

## 🎨 Cosmetic changes (formatting, whitespace, wording)

Improvements to formatting, wording, or structure are welcome as long as they:

- Improve readability
- Keep the template simple and useful

Feel free to open a PR for these kinds of changes.

## ✨ Want to add a feature or improve something?

Before writing code:

- Open a **Feature Request** issue and describe your idea
- Wait for feedback before starting implementation

This helps keep the template consistent and avoids wasted effort.

## 🏷️ Title & naming guidelines

To keep issues and pull requests organized, please use the following prefixes in titles:

### Issue & PR prefixes

- **feat:** a new feature or improvement  
  _Example: `feat: add database documentation template`_

- **fix:** a bug fix  
  _Example: `fix: broken link in README template`_

- **docs:** documentation-only changes  
  _Example: `docs: improve contributing guidelines`_

- **style:** formatting, whitespace, or wording changes  
  _Example: `style: improve section spacing in README`_

- **chore:** maintenance or tooling changes  
  _Example: `chore: update repository structure`_

This helps maintainers quickly understand the purpose of each change.

## ❤️ Final notes

- Be respectful and constructive
- Keep things simple and practical
- If you’re unsure about something, feel free to ask
